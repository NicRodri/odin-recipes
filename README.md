# odin-recipes
This project will be using all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far into practice. This will be done by putting these skills into building a basic recipe website.

The project will be made initially with HTML, and will be revisited later on to style up with CSS.

Once this project is completed, I will have shown skills in:

-Basic HTML knowledge including: lists(ordered and unordered), images, and links.

-The basic Git/Github workflow.
